# Cryptanalysis
Learning cryptography and cryptanalysis  

I am currently following the book Modern Cryptanalysis by Christopher Swenson.
There are separate jupyter notebooks for the exercises at the end of each
chapter along with related code files for keeping the main notebook more
organised.

Chapter-1: Historical and primitve ciphers and there breaks.  
Chapter-2: Modular arithmetic and refresher on mathematics for crypto.  
Chapter-3: Algorithms for factorisation and discrete logarithm problem.  
Chapter-4: Modern hashing and encryption algorithms like MD5, DES and AES.  
...

Chapter-5: General cryptanalysis methods.  
Chapter-6: Linear cryptanalysis.  
Chapter-7: Differential Cryptanalysis.  

This book along with other popular books to study crypto can be found in the
folder Reading Material. Some good supplementary material such as the original
articles decribing the methods can be found in the folder Additional Material.
